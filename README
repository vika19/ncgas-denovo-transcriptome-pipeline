Any step that is followed by a "b", etc. (RunVelvet2b.sh or Step 2b) can be run at the same time as the matching number (RunVelvet.sh or Step2).

Step 0:
You will need to run the start up script to set up your email, project location, and designate if you are using single or double strands.  This can be done with the following command:

  Setup.ba -e <your email> -s <single or double> -r <read length> -i <insert size if double>

For example:

  Setup.ba -e student@university.edu -s double -r 150 -i 400
  Setup.ba -e student@university.edu -s single -r 
  Setup.ba -e student@university.edu -s single  #will have a read length of 150 by default
  Setup.ba -e student@university.edu -s double  #will have a read length of 150 and insert size of 400 by default

You can also get help by using:

  Setup.ba -h

You can get citations for all software by using:

  Setup.ba -c

NOTE: You can change your email and strand setting several times, but the current working directory will only be run the first time.  As long as you don't move the directory, this will not cause any issues.
Also, this step can take a bit of time, and you can ignore any sed related errors - that is expected at this time!

Step 1:
Put all your reads into input_files - DO THIS AFTER STEP 0! Otherwise it will take forever!
Read the README in input_files to get instructions for combining reads properly into input files.
You can do this with symlink (use command "man ln" if you are unfamiliar with this command).

Then run the normalization command - this will normalize your data and make it take less time/resources without loss of information.
Command: qsub RunTrinity.normalize.sh

Step 2: SOAP
Run RunSOAP1.sh and RunSOAP1b.sh at the same time.
Command: qsub RunSOAP1*
When they finish, run ./Combine.sh
Command: ./Combine.sh

Step 2b: Velvet
Run RunVelvet1.sh and RunVelvet1b.sh at the same time.  
Command: qsub RunVelvet1*
When BOTH above are complete, run RunVelvet2.sh and RunVelvet2b.sh at the same time.  
Command: qsub RunVelvet2*
When BOTH above are complete, run RunVelvet3.sh and RunVelvet3b.sh at the same time.  When they finish, run ./Combine.sh (no need to submit to queue).
Command: qsub RunVelvet3*
When they finish, run ./Combine.sh
Command: ./Combine.sh

Step 2c: TransAbyss
Run RunTransAb1.sh and RunTransAb1b.sh at the same time.
Command: qsub RunTransAbyss1*
When they finish, run ./Combine.sh
Command: ./Combine.sh

Step 2d: Trinity
Run RunTrinity.sh, there is no combine script for this assembler.
Command: qsub RunTrinity.sh

Step 3: Combine all outputs
The outputs for each combined set will be placed automatically in final_assembly.
Run ./Combine.sh FIRST to get one input for Evigenes
Run RunEviGene.sh 
Command: ./Combine.sh; qsub RunEviGene.sh

OUTPUT:
In final_assemblies, you will see the following directories:
	okayset - where the good files are
	dropset - where dropped files are

within okayset, you will set two sets of files:
	okay.fa/aa/cds - these are the highest quality transcripts
		anything labeled "complete" is a full cds 
	okalt.fa/aa/cds - these are the alternative versions of the transcripts in the okay file (alleles, isoforms, etc).
		anything labeled "complete" is a full cds.

SEE http://arthropods.eugenes.org/EvidentialGene/trassembly.html for documentaiton!

Step 4:
You can continue downstream analysis with the README's in final_assemblies, for annotation, DE, QC (in dev), and using this version with data generated from previous versions of the pipeline!
