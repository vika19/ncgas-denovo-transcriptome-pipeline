As stated in the top README, you can run the 1s together, then the 2s, then the 3s.  

You MUST wait for 1 to finish before launching 2, or 3.
After you are done, run ./Combine.sh

NOTE: Please check the read length and insert length (in RunVelvet2*) settings in the options for Velvet.  The defaults are insert size of 100, though 400 is more common.
