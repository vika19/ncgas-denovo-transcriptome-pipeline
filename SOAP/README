You can run SOAP as described in the main README - run the 1 and 1b together, then ./Combine.sh after they have finished!

There are two major considerations in the configuration of SOAP - PLEASE DO NOT SKIP THESE!

insert length - the default is 100bp insert, though 400 is MUCH more common.
read length - this changes with time, the default is 100bp, but other options are 75bp, 100bp, 150bp, 250bp, or 300bp

Thanks to Lijing Bu of CETI for pointing out the missing defaults here!
